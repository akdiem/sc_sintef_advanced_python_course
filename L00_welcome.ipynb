    "The course is based on Python 3 and covers django, sqlalchemy, psycopg, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Bokeh libraries. The course material is provided as Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to set up a dedicated virtual environment for the course material. This avoids potential conflicts between the libraries required for the practical parts of the course and any previously installed Python libraries. To set up a new conda environment and activate it run\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the environment is activated you can install all required packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "The course material is provided as Jupyter Notebooks and is best accessed via [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) (available in conda). To start a JupyterLab session run\n",

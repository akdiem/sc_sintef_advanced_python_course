    "Python is an _interpreted_, _high-level_ programming language. Interpreted means that Python code is executed _at runtime_. In contrast to that, C and Java are examples of _compiled_ programming languages, which are compiled into _executables_ that produce results/outputs. High-level means that Python is designed to be easily human _readable_, meaning that anyone with any programming experience can (in principle) easily understand Python code.\n",

The use of objects and classes allows for a more intuitive understanding of a lot of code, as well as reuse of code. The main disadvantage is that even simple tasks require comparatively many lines of code, and so most object-oriented codes can look very complex at first. When implementing classes it is very natural to use a mix of procedural and functional programming."

    "This example illustrates how object-oriented programming promotes reusability of code alongside reduction of potential bugs. The procedural paradigm requires a lot of code duplication, which is a major source of errors. Imagine for example, that you now would like to cube functions instead of squaring them. In the procedural example you have to make sure that you change all occurrences of ```square``` to ```cube```. This problem is eliminated in the example of the functional paradigm. However, we need to use a placeholder variable ```squares_``` that is manually defined. Confusing ```squares``` and ```squares_``` is another common source of errors in coding. The example of the object-oriented programming paradigm does not suffer from either of these shortcomings: We simply reapply the _class method_ ```square()``` as often as we like on the same instance of the class ```  "
